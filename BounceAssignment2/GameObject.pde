// This is the base class! 
// Everything in the scene will extend GameObject
// An abstract class means that:
// You can't instantiate it
// You must make a subclass and instantiate that
// Some of the methods can be abstract. That means they have no body
// If the subclass doesn't implement the abstract methods, then it too is abstract
// You can use abstract classes to ensure that a class has an implementation of the abstract methods
